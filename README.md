# MATH-155-Final-Project
Code for the final project in UCLA MATH 155, Spring 2023.
We investigate a procedure to recognize faces by projecting new images into the space spanned by the eigenfaces created via SVD and classifying the faces by comparing against the positions of known individuals. We perform this procedure on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. We write code in Python and run experiments to see the performance and limitations of the method.
